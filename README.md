# Animal-search-form

Using the Radio buttons, the user can select the type of animal they wish to be diplayed.

The search bar can also be used, and this will bring up images of either the animal or alt tag, for instance 'yawning' will bring up all the animals that are yawning.

These images work based on the classes, and tags used to describe each image.
